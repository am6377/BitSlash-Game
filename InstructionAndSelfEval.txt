Self-evaluation/Description of Game

This game was inspired by Shovel Knight. I always wanted to create my own 

version of a plat-former so that’s why I decided to create one. Overall, I want 

the art work and the gameplay to be  Mega-Man 2-esque. 

I made the control for this game very simple. The arrow keys are directional 

input followed by the letter F which  attacks. The currently demoed level one is 

mostly simple to complete.  The level is made out of moving platforms, ghosts which 

are represented by  bunch of gray square for this first iteration. The moving 

platforms don’t have any friction so it makes it harder to play, but I might just add in 

the friction feature.  If a jump is missed between platforms the player is killed by an 

invisible  trigger colliders. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the first level 

and reach a turquoise platform which ends the game.  I put in two obstacles which 

are controlled by a key  and the players must collect the keys in order to move the 

obstacles out of the way.  I also added in ladders in the game because all plat-

formers have ladders. 

	In terms of self evaluation, I believe I could have added much more, but I 

wanted to mainly focus on the level design and the mechanics. Overall, the first level 

is unexciting, but it’s meant to be more of a first level where the player get used to

 the controls and what not. Moving forward, I have lots of great things I want to add 

in terms of mechanics and gameplay which are not crucial as of now, but I will add

 them as time passes.
